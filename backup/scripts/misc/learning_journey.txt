**Title:**  Development Chronicle: From Inception to Operational Functionality

**(0:00-0:45) Project Inception and Foundational Elements**

**Narrator:** This development cycle commenced with the objective of building a robust web application, leveraging a modern JavaScript stack. Our initial codebase, while functional, exhibited a basic structure primarily using HTML, CSS, and fundamental JavaScript. The immediate goal was clear: to create a fully operational web application with dynamic user interactions and persistent data management. The client-side structure was represented in the `client/` directory, containing `css`, `fonts`, `images` and `js` files. The `app.js` was where our server started.

**(0:45-1:30) Identifying Core Challenges and Initial Refinement**

**Narrator:** As development progressed, key challenges emerged. Asynchronous operations, initially handled with basic callbacks, led to complex, hard-to-maintain code. Database interactions, initially rudimentary, highlighted the necessity for refined data handling. We were starting to write some JS code that contained code from different contexts. `server/controllers` and `server/models` did not exist. Security and data integrity were paramount, yet initial implementations were not as robust as required. We were also starting to realise that organization would be key for this project to be maintainable. The `scripts/` folder started to fill out with different scripts as we learnt new technologies.

**(1:30-2:30)  Architectural and Technological Enhancements**

**Narrator:**  We addressed these challenges through strategic architectural refinements and adoption of key technologies. The introduction of a dedicated `server/` directory, with subfolders like `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `models/`, and `routes/`, significantly improved code organization and maintainability. The creation of a modular design pattern for data access and manipulation within `server/models/`, and discrete control logic within `server/controllers/` was implemented. Asynchronous operation management was enhanced by adopting best practices for promise handling, resulting in more efficient and readable code. We began to generate SQL scripts in the `scripts/sqlStuff/` folder to allow for easy setup and testing of the database. The inclusion of custom middleware in `server/middleware/` allowed for more focused logic, such as the `authMiddleware.js`, `httpMiddleware.js`, `loginMiddleware.js`, `manifestMiddleware.js` and `registrationValidationMiddleware.js` files, all of which added value, security and structure to the project. We started writing more efficient and reusable scripts, such as `scripts/jsStuff/generateInsertUsersPasswords.mjs`. On the client side, we separated our JS code into logical sections, `client/js/login.js`, `client/js/registerLogin.js`, and `client/js/tasks.js`. All of these measures combined lead to a much cleaner, understandable project.

**(2:30-3:00) Current Operational State and Technical Proficiency**

**Narrator:** The application now operates with a refined Node.js backend, demonstrating advanced capabilities in user authentication and data management. The implementation of dedicated routing in `server/routes/`, along with the use of a relational database, ensures efficient data handling. The `server/views/` directory, together with the client `client/` directory, allows us to show our data in a logical and well presented way. The project's architectural organization, technological choices, and practical coding improvements have resulted in a robust, maintainable, and functional application. The current codebase is a testament to the application of best practices in web development.
